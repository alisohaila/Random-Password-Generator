# Random-Password-Generator
A simple Python project that I made which is a Random Password Generator during the RBC Summer Code Crunch (SCC) virtual camp.

It is mainly used for converting a weak password into a much stronger password by replacing the characters into symbols, numbers, or other kinds of characters possible. For instance, if your input password contains the letter "s" in it, the program would randomly replace the "s" with "$" or "S", respectively.
